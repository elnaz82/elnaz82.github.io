            <h4>Problem</h4>
            <p>Oasis 2 (O2) is an in-house enterprise web application product for Quest.com & Oneidentity.com websites.
              Besides its many features, It is used to manage projects and assign requests associated with them to team
              members.</p>
            <p>Poor visibility on project timeline and progress of work created an urgent need to improve the process
              and
              come up with a new feature for this product.</p>

            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <p>We designed a new feature to assist project managers to stay in control again by keeping everything
              related to a project in one spot. It helped to avoid confusion, last-minute requests, and escalations.
              Here
              are some of our high-level goals:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Create an easy, visual, and intuitive project planner that everyone will embrace and use</li>
              <li>Data visibility enhancements by displaying project phasing, SLAs, and reporting</li>
              <li>Accurate timeline estimation & notifications to reduce communication friction and delay risks</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="mt-0">My Contribution</h4>
            <p>During the research phase, I worked closely with our business analyst to capture issues based on
              existing
              user behavior. I contributed to <span class="highlight">stakeholders and contextual interviews,
                conducted a competitive
                analysis</span>
              and took the lead in <span class="highlight">creating an affinity mapping.</span> Plus, I created <span
                class="highlight">personas</span> to make sure we are
              designing
              for the
              right user group and <span class="highlight">mapped the user journey for each persona.</span></p>
            <p>I <span class="highlight">moderated brainstorming sessions</span> with our team and was responsible to
              synthesize and analyze data. I
              then designed the user interface for the project planner <span class="highlight">using Sketch and created
                an interactive
                prototype
                in InVision for user testing.</span></p>
            <p>During the evaluation phase, I <span class="highlight">moderated usability testing sessions</span> and
              was
              in charge of analyzing the
              data and deriving design recommendations accordingly. I worked with our BA to <span
                class="highlight">create a reporting area</span>
              in
              the product to provide data visualization to our stakeholders and project managers using <a

            <h4>Questionnaire</h4>
            <p>I teamed up with our business analyst and project manager to understand the main issues team members
              having using our current product feature to manage projects and requests. </p>
            <p>We created and sent out a <span class="highlight">short open-ended questionnaire to 10 users</span> in
              our
              company with different
              roles.
              Our main goal was to capture the main issues of each group and craft our personas based on their needs
              accordingly.</p>

            <h4>Design Alternatives</h4>
            <p>After several brainstorming sessions with the team, we decided to build a new feature for our product.
              We
              called it a project/request planner initially. We came up with a couple of concepts <span
                class="highlight">referring back to
                our user’s needs to make sure we address their pain points.</span>
            </p>
            <p>I designed interfaces for these concepts using Sketch. Due to time constraints, I skipped creating
              wireframes. Mockups for “Request Types” pop-up are created by my colleague Diana. <span
                class="highlight">We tried to use the
                same style guide we have for this product in our new design to maintain consistency.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="mb-10">We broke down projects into two categories: </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Guided projects: The idea is to provide the steps and requests needed to create these type of
                projects
                to guide the project managers create them with minimal effort
              </li>
              <li>Non-guided projects: This is for projects that involve only a few requests</li>
            </ol>
            <h5 class="mt-40">Concept 1 </h5>
            <p>We broke requests to 4 tabs; required, suggested, new, or optional tasks to the project. The goal is to
              have interview sessions with each business unit to find out the types of requests required for each type
              of
              project and automatically load them into the page. <span class="highlight">That way the chances of missing
                a task will be reduced
                for project managers.</span></p>

            <h5>Reporting Dashboard Concept</h5>
            <p>We’ve conducted interview sessions with stakeholders to capture the data they are interested to see.
              Based
              on our sessions, we identified 4 different report types.
            </p>
            <img src="images-dec-19/reports-overview.jpg" class="img-responsive add-border">
            <p>I've added a description for each report to provide a better context and <span class="highlight">address

                the pain points of our director persona journey map where they didn't know which report provides
                what.</span>
              I
              then started to
              create interactive prototypes using Telerik Kendo UI components to create charts.
            </p>
            <p>
              At this point, I wanted to validate
              the datasets of the reports with directors and stakeholders before we proceed further with this feature.

            <h4>Brainstorming</h4>
            <p>Parallel to designing the user interface for the new project planner, we conducted a brainstorming
              session with our users to understand the best way to categorize requests and project types in the
              “Request
              Type” pop-up <span class="highlight">to help project managers pick the right project type upfront.</span>
            </p>
            <p>I took the lead to organize and analyze the result:</p>
            <img src="images-dec-19/brainstorming.png" class="img-responsive">
            <p>Diana created the final pop-up mockup for request/project types based on our card sorting session
              result.</p>
            <h4>User Feedback</h4>
            <p>We presented our ideas to the project managers and stakeholders of the product. We walked users through
              our concepts and explained the flow. At this stage, our goal was to validate our concepts and make sure
              we
              were on the right track.
            </p>
            <p>After presenting each concept, we asked the users how effective they think this feature would be. We
              also
              ask them what are the functionalities that they like and dislike.

              filters to the planner would add 2 more weeks to the project's timeline.</p>
            <p><span class="highlight">As a workaround, I tried to differentiate the cards visually based on their
                status and also created a table view of the same information to reuse existing filter functionality
                in our product. That way we avoided project delay.</span></p>

            <p>I’ve included the status of the request in cards.</p>
            <p>Users can define if a request should start earlier or later than the system's calculated-date. The
              number
              of days can be defined as well. This function will be used to stagger and streamline work in the same

              request
              is adding to the scope of the project (APS red tag). I defined the same style tags to display other
              scenarios

            <p>We created a project taxonomy and conducted several training sessions for the team to

            <ul>
              <li>A project can have multiple phases</li>

            <h4>Impact & Future Directions</h4>
            <p>To measure the result of our work, we defined a set of metrics for evaluation such as:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Churn rate</li>
              <li>Number of guided vs non-guided projects created</li>
              <li>Percentage of required/suggested tasks that are created</li>
              <li>Number of canceled projects (expecting to decrease with the new taxonomy of request type)</li>
              <li>Time spent on creating projects</li>
              <li>Number of delayed projects</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Although we launched this product feature 3 months back and it is still too early to evaluate its full
              impact but we noticed that project managers are saving an average of 15% of their time when creating a
              project
              using guided projects. Plus:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>65% of the required requests are being created</li>
              <li>Only 10% of the suggested requests are being used</li>
              <li>37% of requests are custom</li>

            <p>Based on the data and the feedback from our users, we came up with a list of changes that we can apply
