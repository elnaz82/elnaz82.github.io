            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Quest e-commerce site is the selling point of 128 software products. It’s remained unchanged for a
              couple
              of years after Quest separation from Dell.</p>
            <p>I worked on redesigning and enhancing the experience of this platform with the focus of aligning the
              brand
              with the main marketing site and improving shopping experience to provide a pleasant purchase
              journey. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 mt-90-sm-md-lg mt-40-xs">
            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p>Customers want to have a clear understanding of the specifications and the different editions of the
              products they are buying. Fast checkout process along with access to available savings, will create
              a positive experience and therefore will increase repeat customer rate.
            </p>
            <p>Our high level goals were to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Organize content for deeper engagement</li>
              <li>Align branding to create a consistent experience</li>
              <li>Make the checkout easy and fast for everyone, on any device, anywhere</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 mt-90-sm-md-lg mt-40-xs">
            <h3>My Role</h3>
            <p>I was the main designer for this project however I worked alongside a business analyst, a project
              manager, a data scientist and also collaborated with a 3rd party vendor to hand off design
              requirements and test the outcome.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 mt-90-sm-md-lg mt-40-xs">
            <h3>Scope & Constraints</h3>
            <p>The scope of this project would affect the following areas:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Main product listing page</li>
              <li>Product individual pages</li>
              <li>Shopping cart</li>
              <li>Checkout</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We had a limited budget for this project so we had to eliminate redesigning some
              sections and avoid too much customization of existing modules.</p>
            <p>I had to work with a new team of developers which made communication challenging from time to
              time.</p>
            <p>
              Limited resources for testing and logging bugs was yet another issue because we didn’t have a
              shared environment with the vendor.

            <h3>The Process</h3>
            <h5>Initial Exploration</h5>
            <p>I started my journey by using the platform with fresh eyes to have a deeper understanding of the
              current flow and potential areas of improvement. Following are some of my initial
              findings:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>The listing page had an overwhelming amount of information for each product.</li>
              <li>Quantity of the products could only be adjusted at the cart level and not the product level which is
                not
                standard in other e-commerce sites.
              </li>
              <li>Cart and checkout were both on a single page which made the purchase process seem unnecessarily
                long.
              </li>
              <li>Unless I open different editions of a specific product in a new tab, I didn’t have a way to easily
                compare them both side by side. It required a high cognitive load to focus and identify the
                differences.
              </li>
              <li>In the future, it would be nice to have a single sign-in for both marketing and e-commerce
                domains. A dashboard can create a more personalized experience for our customers.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h5>Early Insights from Data</h5>
            <p>I worked with a data scientist and a BA to understand the current workflow deeper and spot key areas
              for
              improvements based on our existing data. </p>
            <p>Based on an intercept survey conducted on the site, <span class="data">47%</span> of customers claimed
              that it is hard to compare
              and understand the different features came with different editions of certain products.</p>

          <div class="col-xs-12 mt-40 mb-40">
            <blockquote>I couldn’t tell the difference between RemoteScan enterprise and RemoteScan enterprise user

          <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
            <p class="mt-0">Considering that RemoteScan is the second most popular product of Quest and bringing in a
              high revenue to
              the company, the priority to improve this situation became critical right away.</p>
            <p>Plus, the flow in Google Analytics showed that <span class="data">22%</span> of customers abandoned
              shopping cart just to review or
              modify the support plan they chose in the previous step of the checkout. </p>

            <h5>Interviews</h5>
            <p>I also interviewed some of our sales folks to collect direct input from our customers. My main goal was
              to capture some qualitative data to back up our existing quantitative data. Here are a few high-level
              insights I captured from our customers: </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Purchase conditions are buried in the product detail section with other information</li>
              <li>Existing customers may benefit from additional savings but wouldn't know that unless they call sales
              </li>
              <li>Different saving options are obscure while choosing a support plan for certain products</li>
              <li>The checkout process is long and requires too much back and forth</li>
              <li>It is hard to compare product features</li>
            </ol>
            <p>I had a few interview sessions with different business unit stakeholders. My primary goal was to
              understand the business needs and how I could leverage them with our customer needs and kill two birds
              with
              one stone. Here are some of the concerns and needs I identified talking to 3 stakeholders:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The high volume of support calls due to lack of properly formatted information on the site which was
                quite costly
              </li>
              <li>There is a need for a space to promote featured products & new releases</li>
              <li>Lack of context for the customers visiting from external sources</li>
            </ul>

              ensure a clean and informative customer journey to purchase.

            <h5>Further Research</h5>
            <p>At this point, I had enough to start working on the project but what I also wanted to know was to
              look at some broader research sources to understand the best practices of creating a smooth online
              shopping experience.</p>

            <h5>User Flow</h5>
            <p>
              Before I could jump into designing, it was important to confirm my assumptions and define the happy path
              in the process workflow.</p>
            <p>
              I created a new user flow based on my findings so that I could find any steps missed or have issues
              sooner than later. That way I could save time during design by making sure my solution would target
              solving the right problem.</p>
            <p>I went over the flow with the team multiple times. Following is the flow we all agreed to be ideal for
              our customers. </p>

            <p>I created hybrid mockups using sketch, mainly because I had all the necessary components in our design
              library so I could quickly stitch them together.</p>
            <p>I intended to create a click-based prototype in Frontify and test with at least 3-5 users. I will
              explain the details of my finding after user testing in the mockups section.</p>
            <p>I created a mini style guide from<a

                  <p>I used the same hero banner concept we have on Quest marketing site to dedicate a
                    space for promoting new releases and featured products to meet one of the asks from the business
                    during
                    our <em>interview</em> sessions.</p>
                  <p>Based on our <em>card sorting</em> session with stakeholders, We created categories to filter
                    products on
                    this page to make finding a product quicker.</p>
                  <p>The card view concept for each product helped to avoid displaying an overwhelming amount of
                    information to customers and decreased the cognitive load.</p>
                  <p>Prefixing the prices with the currency type abbreviation was another aspect that made pricing
                    clear

                        the product page on the marketing site for accessing further in-depth information.</p>
                      <p>Adding dynamic labels for elements that tied to a certain condition increased clarification

                        decreased sales calls by <span class="data">20%</span>.</p>
                      <p>I also worked with developers to create instant field validation for quantity dropdown and
                        some
                        minor UX enhancements to the element functionality.</p>

                        I gathered the information from our BA and displayed in a tile view, highlighting the

                      <p>I also tried to call out other conditions for the product to reduce sales contact.</p>

                      <p>I divided the cart and checkout into two separate pages, to keep customers stay focused on
                        accomplishing one task at a time.</p>
                      <p>When testing the prototype with candidates, I noticed that some of them missed the promotions
                        presented on product detail pages. I included the savings based on the items they had in
                        the cart on this page as well.</p>
                      <p>Data revealed that going back and forth to update certain items in the cart caused the cart
                        abandonment. We included a link with a pop-up that would let customers change licensing
                        without
                        leaving the cart. This update reduced the cart abandonment rate by <span

                        Interestingly, some of the users thought we are going to steal their card info and print out
                        the
                        card displayed in the plugin.</p>

                <p>The redesign of Quest e-commerce website had a positive impact on the checkout experience and

                  organization in general.</p>
                <p>However the conversion rate has not been significantly increased which means we have more things to
                  do.</p>
                <p>Some of the highlights are:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Contact sales rate decreased by <em>10%</em></li>
                  <li>Cart abandonment rate decreased by
                    <em>17%</em>
                  </li>
                  <li>Checkout completion task time improved by <em>40 seconds</em></li>
