              <li><strong>Stakeholders.</strong> They are constantly promoting their products and announce new features
              </li>
              <li><strong>Partners.</strong> This group includes organizations that architect, integrate, implement,
                deploy and operate
                the systems that enable Quest’s mutual customers. They also promote Quest products to their audience and
                receive deals from Quest.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Sales reps.</strong> Colleagues who assist customers with enterprise sales or any information

              </li>

              They are aware of what their needs are for the business, the problems they are facing and looking for the

              leadership to figure out all the details and money to spend.</p>
            <p>They might feel a bit stressed and anxious about the issues affecting their services and want to find the

            <h3 class="text-center">User Flow & Wireframes</h3>
            <p>Before starting to sketch any ideas, I created a new user flow based on my findings so that I could
              validate my assumptions and identify any steps missed or have issues sooner than later. That way I could
              save
              some time during design by making sure my solution would target solving the right problem.</p>
            <p class="pb-20">My goal was to go through the whole process with stakeholders using this user flow and
              eliminate any uncertain assumptions later in the project.</p>

            <p>It is crucial to know what you are buying before you actually buy it. Nearly all people go through
              product pages
              before making a purchase decision. It's therefore important that they provide, clear and detailed
              information about the features of the product.
            </p>
            <p>
              The main purpose of redesigning product pages are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Increase engagement by telling a visual story about the product and create a more natural

              My Role
            </h3>
            <p>This project was a team effort. I worked on the project/request planner feature that was replaced the old
              style project management tool.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Understand the current user flow</li>
              <li>Work closely with BA to understand the depth of current environment and functionality</li>
              <li>User interviews to identify main tasks and barriers</li>
              <li>Competitive analysis to compare and identify missing features or functionalities that can make working
                with the current product easier and faster
              </li>
              <li>Concept testing with users to make sure the new design will satisfy their needs</li>
              <li>Create mockups and a prototype to show the flow clearly and test with users</li>
              <li>Several iterations on mocks</li>
              <li>Interaction design (drag and drop functionality, constant feedback on progress and status of tasks)
              </li>
              <li>UI testing</li>
              <li>Creating a list of common elements and patterns in an uber spreadsheet to build a style guide for
                designing internal systems

              <li><strong>Scrum owners.</strong> This group is responsible to organize and prioritize tasks

              <li><strong>Individual task owners.</strong> All the team members who are responsible to complete the

              </li>
              <li><strong>Directors.</strong> They need to work with project managers and monitor reports to ensure

                tasks
                automatically created and assigned to proper team members so that I avoid the guesswork and create the
                wrong tasks.
              </li>
              <li>As an Individual task owner, I need to have a visual hierarchy of the tasks assigned to me, filtered
                by
                their urgency so that I don't miss deadlines and split my time appropriately among tasks.
              </li>
              <li>As a director, I need to monitor the progress of the open projects and identify the risks that may
                cause delays to meet deadlines, so that I can plan for them in advance.
              </li>
              <li>As a project manager, I should be able to see the status of the project and identify roadblocks to
                avoid missing deadlines.

            <p>Talking to users of the platform and listing all the main features that were important to the majority of
              them, we came up with a new feature to be implemented as an enhancement to improve user experience and
              efficiency of how we work every day.</p>
            <p>Following are some of the tasks that different user groups will perform on this platform:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Add a correct type of project/request</li>
              <li>Monitor progress of different parameters of the project</li>
              <li>Break projects into different phases</li>
              <li>Each phase will include required and optional tasks along with SLA time in a
                card (color coded) view for easier scanning. New tasks can also be added to each phase if needed
              </li>
              <li>Requests can be added to each task</li>
              <li>Additional section to manage requests with more advanced filtering options to quickly identify

            <p>Since this project was an enhancement to the existing platform, many patterns and elements have been
              reused to maintain consistency.
              Project Request Planner is the only new pattern designed to integrate new functionalities. One of the
              biggest
              challenges with the addition of this feature was the migration of old-style projects into this new
              style. To overcome this
              barrier and gradual migration we defined two types of projects standard (old) and guided (new).

              place and brings the company revenue. Optimizing the form and enhancement to this page will be a win-win
              both for the user since they reached their

                the user

            <p>I started by reading several articles and research papers to find out the primary rules for designing an
              efficient form. Followings are some of the best practices I captured:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Explicitly mark both required and optional fields</li>
              <li>Live inline validation has seen an explosive growth in adoption</li>
              <li>The shorter the form, the better</li>
              <li>Avoid defaulting fields to certain values unless you believe a large portion of your users will select
                that value
              </li>
              <li>Use input masks where necessary</li>
              <li>Auto-focus first form field in desktop to create an indication of where to start</li>
              <li>Match keyboard to input type in mobile</li>
              <li>Use autocomplete where possible to limit typing</li>
              <li>Use sentence case for labels as they are easier to read</li>
              <li>Top-aligned labels have the fastest completion time</li>
              <li>Maintain inline label's placeholder text on focus. (Floating labels is the way to go in this case)
              </li>
              <li>Avoid generic words for submit button</li>
              <li>Avoid reset button and use the main CTA in the place that has the most convenient position for
                clicking in the viewport

            <p class="mb-20">Based on my findings and working with the business analyst about the requirements of the
              flow I have come up with the following flow/style for the new form:</p>

              </li>
              <li>Inline floaty labels to solve the issue with international localities text labels and improve the
                speed of filling out the forms
              </li>
              <li>Required and optional fields are identifiable through *</li>
              <li>Visual indicators for interactions (blue for focus, red for errors, green check marks for
                complete) to make the form more intuitive
              </li>
              <li>Inline live validation to:</li>
              <ul>

                <li>avoid skipping a required field unintentionally</li>

            <p>We wanted to try and see how motion can make data more valuable and create a better connection with the

              this new page:</p>

              <li>Grasp the severity of issues and how the solution can help solve them by seeing numbers based on
                research

            <p>After becoming an independent company with a new brand, the need to have this information gathered in
